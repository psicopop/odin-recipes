    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds frozen bread dough, thawed</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped cooked turkey</li>
        <li>1 cup prepared stuffing</li>
        <li>1 cup prepared mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Break off 2-inch pieces of dough and flatten each piece as thin as possible without breaking using a rolling pin. Spoon about 1 teaspoon turkey, 1 teaspoon stuffing, 1 teaspoon mashed potatoes, and 1 teaspoon vegetables onto each piece of flattened dough. Gently close dough around filling, sealing edges together and forming a ball. Arrange filled dough balls in the prepared baking dish; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dough balls are cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes. Invert monkey bread onto a serving dish.</li>
